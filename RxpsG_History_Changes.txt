=== June 2024 ===
The whole package has been rewritten using directly the tclTK functions.
This allows avoiding the need of gWidgets2, gWidgets2tcltk, memoise libraries.
The GUIs in the new program are almost equal to those of the previous RxpsG version
but more responsive. 
A list of bugs vere eliminated and efficiency of the package overall increased.
==> It is highly suggested to use this new version of the RxpsG package.


=== May 2023 ===
Still some bugs fixed throughout the whole software.
Added/controlled documentations for all the functions, classes and methods.
Modified function to make the reports of the analyses performed.
Modified XPSAnalysisGUI.R, XPSMoveCompGUI.R, XPSExtractGUI.R, XPSSprucingGUI.R, 
XPSVBTopGUI.R, XPSZoomCurGUI.R to read mouse position from graphs using the 
locator() function. This allow the macro to be compatible with LINUX
operating systems.


=== December 2022 ===
All options for describing XPSSample and Core-Lines and XPSReport were improved
and bugs fixed.


=== August 2022 ===
Corrected bugs in XPSAnalysis XPSSwitchBE.KE.GUI
Corrected bug in XPSMoveCompGUI.r for the construction of the component list menu
Corrected XPSProcessCoreline.r
Corrected XPSSpectNamechange.r bug on the CoreLine-Symbol
Modified XPSDiffGui adding personal derivative amplification factor
Modified XPSFilterGUI added frequency response of the selected filter
MOdified XPSOverlayGUI allowing use of colored linepatterns (not solid only)
Written new Convolution-deconvolution macro
Modified XPSProcessCorelineGUI added decimation option
Modified XPSImportAscii to import data-tables composed by couples of X,Y columns 
     Now XY couples of different length may be imported.
Added procedure for calculation of the Convolution/Deconvolution of spectra
Added spectral Interpolation/Decimation option

***Voigt profile now calculated using real convolution. Eliminated library "NORMT3".
Shirley background code in XPSCustomBaseline.r. Library "baseline" optinal:
     "Element identification" function is active only if "baseline" is installed.
Library "FME" now optional: "Modfit" is active only if "FME" is installed
Library "wavelets" now optional: "wavelet filter" active only if "wavelets" is installed.


=== June 2022 ===
Verified different behavior in generating TK-graphic windows. All macros whereit is needed
a TK-window for interactive selection of spectral points by mouse are modified. 
Now use of library GRDevices and relative functions to capture mouse click events.
Semplified and more robust procedures implemented. Compatible with Windows and Linux,
However, GRDevices do not support the Quartz geraphic device.
Following routines were modified:
XPSAnalysisGUI.r, XPSMoceCompGUI.r, XPSExtractGUI.r, XPSSprucingGUI.r, XPSVBTopGUI.r, 
XPSConstraintsGUI.r


=== March 2022 ===
Corrected small bugs in XPSOverlayEngine, XPSCustomPlot
Rationalized the XPSSaveDataGUI, corrected bug in XPSImportAsciiGUI for loading Yerrors.
Corrected bugs in XPSDiff, XPSCustomBaseline


=== December 2021 ===
Corrected structure package RxpsG to follow the standard skeleton
created the folder RxpsG/inst/extdata  
to contain Auger and CoreLine Tables, Element.ini, XPSSettings.ini RxpsG.gif and the BkpData.Rdata files
and RxpsG/inst/doc
to contain the manual.pdf
Eliminated the folder RxpsG/data
This change makes the search of the above listed Package_Data_Files more easy and stable.



=== November 2021 ===
corrected instPckgs now installs also the dependences
corrected XPSMoveBaseline: now sets the limits for all the baseline types


=== July 2021 ===
- Modified RXPSG.r, XPSOverlayGUI.r to correcly identify the name of Differentiated or Smoothed 
corelines (Problems due to presence of dots as separators). 
- XPSOverlayGUI.r: solved problem in the zoom function related to the definition of the 
zooming area.
- correct bug in updating the Graphic window (TKwindow or X11) when using XPSConstraintsGUI()
and XPSMoveCompGUI() in combination.
- Modified RXPSG() to recover the R version used by RStudio and save in .GlobalEnv.
- Modified XPSSaveDataGUI() adding options to save in format compatible for old R versions.
- Modified XPSExtract() now extract works not only on survey but also on corelines
- Corrected Combine procedure in XPSProcessCorelineGUI()
- Corrected bug in XPSMoveCoreline()



=== May 2021 ===

XPSConstraintsGui() and XPSMoveComp() now may work in combination. Changes of coreline fit-parameters
done in XPSConstraintsGUI() are visualized in the TKplot graphic window opened in XPSMoveComp().
XPSConstraintsGUI() and XPSMoveComp() can also work independently each other.



=== December 2020 ===

Corrected bug in RxpsG: in path_names change "/" to "\" only for Windows operating systems



=== October 2020 ===
XPSProcessing, XPSMoveComponents, XPSExtract, XPSVBTop. All these routines need interactive graphics.
GWidgets2TclTK allow interactive graphics via tkrplot library or using graphic handlers
getGraphicsEventEnv() fired by clicking the mouse in the active graphic device.  
In the new version, TCL/TK commands are integrated in the routines rendering the XPSProcessing, 
XPSMoveComponents, XPSExtract, and XPSVBTop completely compatible with Windows and Linux operative 
systems. Since the tkrplot library does not supports the Apple quartz graphic device, a version 
of the routines based on getGraphicsEventEnv() is available for Apple operative systems. 

XPSFitLM modified adding a logical parameter plt to select if potting or not fitting results. By default
plt=TRUE. plt=FALSE when TK graphic device is used in the XPSProcessing, XPSMoveComponents, XPSExtract,
and XPSVBTop procedures.

XPSImportGUI modified adding possibility to import standard errors associated to sets of data.

XPSread.scienta, XPSRead.OldScienta, XPSRead.vamas modified to store an additional dummy area where
to store the standard errors or other kinds of data

XPSImportAscii modified to read and store standard errors affecting data. For each column of data a
column of error must be present. SaveError option will save errors in an predesignated memory location.

XPSCustomPlot modified to plot generic Ascii-data together with their standard errors. Observe that these
data can only be imported using XPSImportAscii since XPS provide only nude spectra and not any standard
error is associated to these data. In addition Log scale option modified to draw real X, Y log10 scales

XPSQuantifyGUI modified adding the possibility to write quantification results to file.



=== January 2020 ===

XPSCompare.r: new function added added to RxpsG. This function allows overlapping different core-lines
              from different XPS-Samples. For each coreline a panel is generated to compare spectra. 

XPSMoveComponents: now possible to change window dimension.

XPSVmsCorrGui.r: correction for analyzer energy transfer function error fixed

XPSRead.VMS.r: fixed error reading vamas files without Analyzer Energy Transfer Function


=== August 2019 ===
XPSFilter: moving average filter corrected
           wavelets filter corrected

XPSSurElementIdentify: bugs fixed

XPSSurveyUtility modified call to XPSSurElementIdentify.

XPSElemTable (piu' survey error)

AugerTransitions.lib 

ProcessCoreLineGui some error fixed

XPSClass just comments removed

XPSConstraintsGUI  the notebook Link page completely restyled: now more easy to set links, 
ctrls to avoid errors

XPSElementTabGUI  modified routine to get multiple cursor positions

XPSZoomCurGUI   eliminated assignments in MyEnv using <<-   modified GUI with choice of XPSSamples 
and corelines

XPSSampleInfoGUI save edited Sample information: bug fixed

XPSUtilities: in XPSFindXindex() XPSFindYindex() error was generated when void vectors passed to 
these routines. Now bug corrected. 

XPSProcess: removed error generated when add fitcomponent pressed without any position set

XPSEShiftGUI.r: fixed bug in the reset energy shift procedure.

XPSOverlayGui.r: now it is possible to readjust the intensity of a given CoreLine when comparing spectra from the same XPSSample

XPSPreferencesGUI.r: added option to set user defined X-photon energy to include Synchroton radiations

XPSMoveCompGUI.r: modified adding selection of the XPSSample

XPSSplit.r: macro revised to allow splitting files composed by an unlimited number of core-lines
           (macro tested on an XPS-Sample composed by 64 core-lines)
